Here you'll find a set of scripts and Chef recipes for setting up Asterisk on Ubuntu on EC2.

We're assuming you have setup your local EC2 command line tools or use the AWS Console.

1. Start an instance of Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)

ec2-run-instances....

2. Login as root and check out this repo (or fork your own and use that)

# apt-get update
# apt-get install git-core
# git clone git://github.com/jsierles/asterisk-chef.git

3. Run a script to setup Chef

# cd asterisk-chef
# scripts/ec2_chef.sh

4. Install the chef recipes

# rake install

5. Run the example Chef config file to see Chef in action

# chef-solo -j config/example.json

6. Edit example.json to your tastes and re-run #5 to see results
